# Kindle Direct Publishing Specifications

In order to publish on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) we need to export the Markdown files into one of several standard formats. Kindle Create is an app by Amazon for creating and editing Kindle eBooks. Kindle Create stores the book in encrypted format but there is a DOCX file for interfacing with MS Word.
