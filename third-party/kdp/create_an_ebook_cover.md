# Create an eBook Cover

Browse the topics below to learn about creating an eBook cover. The cover image you upload will appear on your Amazon detail page. Before you start creating your cover, make sure you have all rights necessary for the content of your cover image and that it complies with our Content Guidelines. When you publish or re-publish your eBook, we'll automatically add your cover image to the inside. Do not include your cover image in your manuscript file.

## File types
KDP currently accepts two types of files for cover images:

* JPEG (JPEG / JPG)
* TIFF (TIF / TIFF)

We apply additional compression to images when displaying them on the website. For the best results, upload your images with minimal compression.

## Dimensions

The ideal size of your eBook cover art is a height/width ratio of 1.6:1. This means that for every 1,000 pixels in width, the image should be 1,600 pixels in height. To ensure the best quality for your image, particularly on high definition devices, the height of the image should be at least 2,500 pixels. Ideal dimensions for cover files are 2,560 x 1,600 pixels.

**Note:** The minimum image size allowed is 1,000 x 625 pixels. The maximum image size allowed is 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.

## Size

Your cover image must be less than 50MB. Try to avoid compressing your files. This can affect the quality of your cover when displayed on reading devices. For the best results, images should have a minimum resolution of 300 PPI (pixels per inch).

## Color

Product images display on the Amazon website using the RGB (red, green, blue) color mode or profile. RGB is the color mode native to the web and many color screen displays. Displayed at varying levels of intensity, these three colors create over 16 million colors. When saving and uploading your cover image file, save your file as RGB (not CMYK or sRGB) for the color profile. Look for this option in the File saving dialog of image editing programs like Photoshop.

Some programs may also refer to RGB color as "True Color." If in doubt, try opening a JPG inside Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari. If a JPG opens fine inside a web browser, it's probably okay to use as a cover image.

Make sure to save your image without color separation. This is usually a pre-press or color palette option. Use your image editing program or image analysis tool (some are available free online) to verify that your image file doesn't have color separation.

When uploading your final cover file to KDP, you will see an error occur if there is an issue with color mode or size.

Use color images whenever possible and relevant. In addition to the Kindle black and white E Ink reading devices, customers can read your books on full color Fire devices and free Kindle reading apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, PC or Mac.

## Borders for white cover art

Cover art with white or very light backgrounds can seem to disappear against the white background. Try adding a narrow (3-4 pixel) border in medium gray to define the boundaries of the cover.

## How to upload your cover

1. Go to your Bookshelf
2. Click the ellipsis button ("...") under the KINDLE EBOOK ACTIONS menu and select "Edit eBook Content"
3. Select "Upload a cover you already have" under the "Kindle eBook Cover" header
4. When you see a pop-up window appear, click Browse to find your cover image file on your computer and click Open
5. If your image meets our specifications, you will see a "Processing" message
6. Once your image completes the conversion process, the message "Cover uploaded successfully" will appear, along with the thumbnail for your cover image
7. Scroll to the bottom of page and click Save and Continue

You'll be redirected to the eBook Pricing page. Click the button at the bottom of the page to publish your book changes. For information on timelines, including details on new publications and updates to published books, see our Help page.

**Note:* The image you see in preview is only a placeholder while your book completes the publishing process.


## Product image placeholders

If you don't have a product image, or choose not to upload one, we'll add a placeholder image to the Amazon detail page for your eBook. It will contain the title of your book and the first contributor name you entered. It can take up to one week to see the placeholder image on your detail page. 

Having a product image, even if it's only a placeholder, is a better customer experience than displaying a message that an image is not available. We encourage you to design and upload your own image to capture customer attention.

To replace the placeholder image with your own image:

1. Go to your Bookshelf
2. Find the eBook to which you want to add an image
3. Click the ellipsis button ("...") under the KINDLE EBOOK ACTIONS menu and select "Edit eBook Content"
4. Upload an image under the "Kindle eBook Cover" header

After submission, the image will be reviewed and go live if it meets our requirements. 

Did you change the title or author of your book and are unable to upload your own image? Contact us for help updating your placeholder image. We will delete the existing placeholder, which will trigger a new one to be generated within one week.
